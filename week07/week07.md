# Vulnerability Analysis and Patching

# Resources

* MITRE CVE Dictionary: https://cve.mitre.org/
* National Vulnerability Database: https://nvd.nist.gov/
* Cucumber Linux Security Tracker: https://security.cucumberlinux.com/

The MITRE CVE Dictionary is the main place where all CVEs get logged. There is a page for each vulnerability, which contains links to other resources pertaining to that vulnerability. The National Vulnerability Database mirrors all of the information in the MITRE CVE Dictionary, but it also adds additional information not found on MITRE (such as the CVVS vulnerability severity score).
