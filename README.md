# Cucumber Linux from Scratch Interest Group

Welcome to the Cucumber Linux from Scratch Interest Group! We meet in the
SECLab (GOL 2410) on Wednesdays from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM.

This semester (Spring 2019), we will be diving deep into Linux internals and
open source development. We will do this by taking the knowledge from the 
Fall 2018 semester and using it to contribute to the official Cucumber Linux
Project!

If you would like to join us but are not already on our email list, please fill
out the form at

and someone will be in touch with you shortly.

# Previous Semesters

In Fall of 2018, we built our own Linux systems from source, from scratch using
a process very similar to Linux from Scratch. We then explored more advanced
Linux topics such as security patching and package porting. For details on what we did this semester, see the README-2018-fall.md file in this directory.

# Getting Help

As with most technical problems, DuckDuckGo (or whatever your favorite search
engine is) is a good place to start when you run into issues. If that's not
doing the trick, feel free to email me at scott@cucumberlinux.com or hop on our
IRC channel: #cucumberlinux on freenode.net.
