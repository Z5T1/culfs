# Cucumber Linux from Scratch Interest Group

Welcome to the Cucumber Linux from Scratch Interest Group! We meet in the
SECLab (GOL 2410) on Sundays from 2:00 to 4:00.

In this group, we will be setting out to each build our own Linux systems from
source, from scratch! This process will basically follow the process outlined
in Linux from Scratch. Once we have built our systems, we will then explore
more advanced Linux topics, such as fixing security vulnerabilities, security
hardening, customizing your system, adding your own packages and anything else
people are interested in.

If you would like to join us but are not already on our email list, please fill
out the form at

and someone will be in touch with you shortly.

# Virtual Machine Snapshots

Every week, I will be working on my own virtual machine. I encourage all of you
to work on your own machines as well. That being said, the work we do in this
interest group is cumulative; if you miss one week, you will not be able to do
the next week's activity until you get your VM caught up. I realize it is not
reasonable to expect everyone to be able to attend every single week, so each
week I will be takng a snapshot of my VM and making that available for you to
use the following week if your VM isn't quite up to speed. So if you start to
get behind with your VM, don't worry; you all have enough to worry about
already. You can just make a copy of mine next week.

Unfortunately, the virtual machine image is too large for me to upload
anywhere, so if you need a copy you will have to get it from me in person. You
can do this by either tracking me down on campus or by arriving to the meeting
15 minutes early on the day you want to copy it.

The document for each week will indicate which snapshot was taken at the end of
that week.

# Getting Help

As with most technical problems, DuckDuckGo (or whatever your favorite search
engine is) is a good place to start when you run into issues. If that's not
doing the trick, feel free to email me at scott@cucumberlinux.com or hop on our
IRC channel: #cucumberlinux on freenode.net.
