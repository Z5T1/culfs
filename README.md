# Cucumber Linux from Scratch Interest Group

Welcome to the Cucumber Linux from Scratch Interest Group! We meet in the
SECLab (GOL 2410) on Sundays from 2:00 to 4:00.

In this group, we will be setting out to each build our own Linux systems from
source, from scratch! This process will basically follow the process outlined
in Linux from Scratch. Once we have built our systems, we will then explore
more advanced Linux topics, such as fixing security vulnerabilities, security
hardening, customizing your system, adding your own packages and anything else
people are interested in.

If you would like to join us but are not already on our email list, please fill
out the form at

and someone will be in touch with you shortly.

# Getting Help

As with most technical problems, DuckDuckGo (or whatever your favorite search
engine is) is a good place to start when you run into issues. If that's not
doing the trick, feel free to email me at scott@cucumberlinux.com or hop on our
IRC channel: #cucumberlinux on freenode.net.
