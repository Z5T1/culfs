# Finishing the Cucumber Linux from Scratch Build

This week, we will be finishing up our Cucumber Linux from Scratch builds. We
will be following build process as written at
https://wiki.cucumberlinux.com/wiki/cucumber_linux_from_scratch. This week, we
will pick up at the end of building phase 3 and continue though the end of the
guide. When we are done, you will end up with your own custom installation ISOs
for your own build of Cucumber Linux!
