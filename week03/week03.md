# Building Cucumber Linux from Scratch through Phase 1

For the next few weeks, we will be following the Cucumber Linux from Scratch
build process as written at
https://wiki.cucumberlinux.com/wiki/cucumber_linux_from_scratch. This week, we
will building though the end of Phase 1; this will include building a temporary
system that will be used to build the final system. For those of you who are
familiar with Linux from Scratch, this akin to building through the end of
chapter 5.

For a visual depiction of how this process works, please see the drawing in
build_diagram.jpeg. We will be going over this diagram in depth.
